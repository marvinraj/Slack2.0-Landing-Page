![Slack2.0 Screenshot](link_to_project_screenshot.png)

Welcome to Slack2.0, a basic clone of the popular Slack messaging platform. This project was built using HTML and CSS and serves as a simple landing page (home page) for the site.

## About

Slack2.0 is a project created to explore web development concepts and replicate the look and feel of the Slack website. Please note that it currently represents only the landing page and is not responsive. Future improvements are planned to make it a fully functional and responsive Slack clone.

## Features

- **Landing Page:** Experience a basic recreation of Slack's landing page, complete with header, hero section, and footer.

## Getting Started

To view the Slack2.0 landing page, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. No additional setup is required.

## Roadmap

While the current version of Slack2.0 is a static landing page, future plans for this project include:

- Adding interactive elements to mimic Slack's functionality.
- Making the website responsive for various screen sizes.
- Expanding the project to include additional pages and features.
